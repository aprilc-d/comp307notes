What is a brower?

What is HTML?
It is NOT a programming language
It is a text formatting language
It helps you describe how a webpage should look
It allows you to place content on a page

The standard generalized markup language (SGML) is a standard for defining generalized markup languages for documents
EXtensible HyperText Markup Language.  XHTML was developed to make HTML more extensible and flexible to worth with othe data formats (XML) XHTML comes with much stricter eror handling

XHTML is a superset of HTML5
 SGML is a superset of XHTML

Important to note that HTML does NOT display in the same way on all browers

Local development is when you build websites on your machine that is not connected to the Internet
Developers often start a project this way before putting it on a server
We will use a text editor to write the pages and then drag to brower to render

On the frontend we use
	personal computer
	browser
	html + css

On the back end
	local server (no internet)
	server programming files
